# Welcome to Setsuna

Setsuna is a modern functional programming language written in C++ with a clean, expressive syntax inspired by ML-family languages while maintaining familiar C-style conventions.

## Why Setsuna?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Functional First" icon="function">
    First-class functions, closures, and higher-order functions make functional programming natural and intuitive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pattern Matching" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Powerful pattern matching with destructuring for lists, tuples, records, and algebraic data types.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type Inference" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Hindley-Milner type inference means less boilerplate while maintaining type safety.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean Syntax" icon="code">
    C-style syntax that's familiar yet expressive, with arrow functions and match expressions.
  </Card>

## Quick Example

```setsuna
// Define a recursive function
fn factorial(n) {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        _ => n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

// Higher-order functions
fn map(f, lst) {
    match lst {
        [] => [],
        [head, ...tail] => cons(f(head), map(f, tail))
    }
}

// Use them together
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let factorials = map(factorial, numbers)
print(factorials)  // [1, 2, 6, 24, 120]
```

## Features

- **Rich Data Types**: Integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, tuples, and records
- **Algebraic Data Types**: Define custom types with multiple constructors
- **Modules**: Organize code into reusable namespaced modules
- **REPL**: Interactive development with immediate feedback
- **Pattern Matching**: Destructure and match against complex data structures

## File Extension

Setsuna source files use the `.stsn` extension.
