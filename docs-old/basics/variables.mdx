# Variables & Bindings

In Setsuna, variables are created using `let` bindings. All bindings are immutable by default, embracing functional programming principles.

## Let Bindings

The `let` keyword creates a new variable binding:

```setsuna
let name = "Setsuna"
let age = 1
let pi = 3.14159
let active = true
```

## Type Inference

Setsuna automatically infers the type of variables from their values:

```setsuna
let x = 42        // Int
let y = 3.14      // Float
let s = "hello"   // String
let b = true      // Bool
```

<Note>
You don't need to specify types - Setsuna's type inference figures them out automatically.
</Note>

## Shadowing

You can shadow a variable by binding a new value to the same name:

```setsuna
let x = 5
print(x)  // 5

let x = x * 2
print(x)  // 10

let x = "now a string"
print(x)  // "now a string"
```

Shadowing creates a new binding rather than mutating the existing one.

## Scope

Variables are scoped to their containing block:

```setsuna
let outer = 1

{
    let inner = 2
    print(outer)  // 1 - can access outer scope
    print(inner)  // 2
}

// print(inner)  // Error: inner is not in scope
```

## Let in Functions

Variables defined in functions are local to that function:

```setsuna
fn calculate() {
    let result = 42
    result * 2
}

print(calculate())  // 84
// print(result)    // Error: result is not in scope
```

## Naming Conventions

<Info>
Variable and function names should use `snake_case`. Type names and constructors use `PascalCase`.
</Info>

```setsuna
// Good
let user_name = "Alice"
let total_count = 100
fn calculate_sum(numbers) => ...

// Types use PascalCase
type Option {
    Some(value),
    None
}
```

## Examples

### Compound Bindings

```setsuna
let a = 10
let b = 20
let sum = a + b
let product = a * b

print("Sum: " + str(sum))        // Sum: 30
print("Product: " + str(product)) // Product: 200
```

### Using Let with Functions

```setsuna
// Bind a function result
let squared = (x) => x * x
let result = squared(5)
print(result)  // 25

// Chain operations
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let doubled = map((x) => x * 2, numbers)
let sum = fold((a, b) => a + b, 0, doubled)
print(sum)  // 30
```
