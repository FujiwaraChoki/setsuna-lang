# Installation

Setsuna can be built from source on any platform with a C++17 compiler.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum Version |
|-------------|-----------------|
| C++ Compiler | C++17 support (GCC 8+, Clang 7+, MSVC 2019+) |
| CMake | 3.16+ |
| Make | Any recent version |

## Building from Source

### Linux / macOS

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FujiwaraChoki/setsuna-lang.git
cd setsuna-lang

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# Optional: Install system-wide
sudo make install
```

### Windows

Using Visual Studio:

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FujiwaraChoki/setsuna-lang.git
cd setsuna-lang

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build with MSBuild
cmake --build . --config Release
```

## Verifying Installation

After building, verify the installation:

```bash
./setsuna --help
```

You should see:

```
Setsuna Programming Language v0.1.0

Usage:
  setsuna              Start REPL
  setsuna <file.stsn>  Run a file
  setsuna --help       Show this message
```

## Project Structure

After building, your project structure should look like:

```
setsuna-lang/
├── build/
│   └── setsuna          # The compiled interpreter
├── src/                 # Source files
├── examples/            # Example .stsn programs
├── docs/                # Documentation
└── CMakeLists.txt
```

## Running Examples

Test your installation by running the included examples:

```bash
./build/setsuna examples/factorial.stsn
./build/setsuna examples/fibonacci.stsn
./build/setsuna examples/list_ops.stsn
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="CMake version too old">
    If you get CMake errors, ensure you have version 3.16 or higher:
    ```bash
    cmake --version
    ```
    Update CMake through your package manager or download from cmake.org.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compiler doesn't support C++17">
    Setsuna requires C++17. Check your compiler version:
    ```bash
    g++ --version  # GCC
    clang++ --version  # Clang
    ```
    Update to a recent version if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build fails on Windows">
    Ensure Visual Studio 2019 or later is installed with C++ development tools.
    Use the "Developer Command Prompt" for building.
